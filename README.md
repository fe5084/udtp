UDTP API for C++ Documentation
====

UDTP is a file transfer implementation to the User Datagram protocol. It uses a set amount of threads to send a file, split up in optimal size, more faster and efficiently than standard TCP. Both server and client will have a process to check the integrity of the file through an acknowledgement system.

It is currently still under development.
